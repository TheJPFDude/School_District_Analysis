# School District Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide a report on high school math and reading scores for a school district. This report includes values such as % of students passing (in math, reading, and overall) based on many variables such as school size, grade, and so on.

## Results

- How is the district summary affected?

The new scores and percentage passing are lower for almost every category, although the changes were miniscule (0.1 difference). The Average Reading Score was the only variable that did not change with the addition of the NaN values.
    
- How is the school summary affected?

The only changes are reflected in the Thomas High School row's scores and percentage passing. The new numbers are slightly lower although surprisingly, the Average Reading Score is higher in the new DataFrame.
    
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Because the changes that occured were very miniscule, replacing the scores did not affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools -- namely, Thomas is still second overall in Overall Passing among all schools.

- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade

  The only changes that occured were that Thomas High School 9th graders' scores are NaN. Otherwise, no changes between the old and new analysis.

  - Scores by school spending

  Score replacement did not change these values.

  - Scores by school size

  Score replacement did not change these values.

  - Scores by school type

  Score replacement did not change these values.

## Summary

Overall, after doing the updated school district analysis, there were only a few changes that occured from the old to new analysis. One big change was that in the Math and Reading Scores by Grade analysis, Thomas High School 9th graders had NaN for their scores rather than a number, which makes sense due to the removal of their scores. 

Another change occured in the district summary, where the averages and percentage passing were a tick down for almost all variables. 

Surprisingly, the Average Reading Score did not decrease in the district summary, and even increased a bit when looking at the school summary in the row showing Thomas High School's data. 

Finally, there was a decrease in Thomas High School's averages and percentage passing for almost all categories (except for the one mentioned before).
